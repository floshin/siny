    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="bigtext">At SinY we are united by a deep love for acrobatics.
      We are nerds of acrobatic technique and experts for Inversion.</p>
        
    <p>Combining the knowledge of acrobatic gymnastics with yogic traditions for the general population, into a form of training accessible for everyone. Since 2017 we provide a plethora of freely available information on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sinyinversion_yoga/" target="_blank">social platforms</a> as an open source knowledge base, which had an influence both on acro and the east-european yoga community as a whole.</p> 
        
    <p>We also offer <a href="#coaching">Online Training</a>, starting from basic Inversions to high-level handbalancing, by which we sustain our small team of professional acrobats and <a href="#team">coaches</a>.</p>
      
    <p>In form of our <a href="https://blog.siny.online">textbook</a> we are in the process of constructing a comprehensive knowledge base about all the little details of handstands.</p>

          <h3>Our Team</h3>

          <p>Founded by Galina Nikolaevna Sinyavskaya and Olga Aleksandrovna Yatsenko, <strong>Siny Inversion Yoga</strong> (short SinY) combines Galinas experience as an acrobatic gymnastics coach with Olgas background in Yoga. Being a small circle that originated from within the acrobatics community of Kyiv, Ukraine, we teach acrobatics and handstands on a high technical level.</p> 
        
          <img class="founders" src="assets/team/Galina-Olya-sm-v1.jpg">
        
          <p>Galina Nikolaevna trains her team of acrobats and a small senior group of professional handbalancers and enthusiasts online in Russian, while Olga is the driving force and face of the organisation. Alongside Ivan Labunets and Pavlov Kucherov she is teaching the Online Groups in Ukrainian, Russian and English, Florian in English and German.</p>

      <h2>Online Training</h2>

      <p>Our online training is focused on Handbalancing. We do not sell courses. The training is held live in form of actual online classes, where you can always get feedback from a coach.</p>
       
      <p>We have different groups structured in skill levels and train everyone, from absolute beginners with no training experience whatsoever over those, who have a training background but have not yet developed a stable handstand or are lacking in technique, to advanced practitioners who already can stand on their hands comfortably and want to bring their basic handstand to the next level.</p>
        
      <p>The training is held in Russian or Ukrainian and English. More English and German classes are planned to be available in the future.</p>

      <p>Apart from the handbalancing focused groups with fixed training times there are limited places for individual online training sessions to accomodate to your schedule. We also have regular conditioning classes focused on the development of the endurance, strength and stability as the necessary foundation of your handbalancing practice.</p>

          <blockquote>I love the method of Galina and Olga. All elements as a whole are first disassembled into small pieces, honed to perfect execution, and then glued together into a technically executed element. You will never sit around or take a lot of rest. During the exercises everyone in our group receives a comment about the performance. And attention to detail is always paid, which is very important. By training with Galina and Olga you will get not only an excellent handstand, but also a strong, prepared body with which you can work in other directions.</blockquote></li>

        <blockquote class="smalltext">I've been following the feed for a long time. I am very glad that Galina, Olya and the acrobats made this project and teach online. They are very talented and hardworking people who do a unique job. Handstands, Stalders, Planches, One Arms. I've always been very interested in how they work, how to train it, how to do it technically. But training alone is boring and inefficient. As you want to learn how to do an element, but you don't know how, what to do, how much, or how it works. I am very happy that I trained with Siny Inversion Yoga. We sometimes have up to 8 people in a group. Training is always difficult, but interesting. Galina always comes up with different exercises. Stalders, handstands - this is physical work, so it's hard, but jokes and motivation from the coach, working with other people, all this makes the process interesting. I improved the technique of my Stalder Press and the stand on one hand. I increased strength and endurance. I really hope that I will be able to meet them live in Kyiv someday.</blockquote></li>

        <blockquote>I worked with SinY Inversion for around one year. I would like to say that these coaches are the best with whom I worked so far. Practices are difficult, but it works. Flags were inaccessible for me, but thanks to SinY Inversion my flags improved and they showed exercises specifically for me, which helped me a lot. Now I improve my flags and move forward.</blockquote></li>
