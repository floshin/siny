Try the following:

Make a general SinY page.
With a nice new logo and a cover with a photo or blending photo slides. 
There have this section about the team etc. 
And then at the cover page have like two sections..
something like the "suzirya" section on ukrainian acrobatics, a graphical link
with a brutalist thick border and another graphical link to the acro lib;
both may then be integrated into this one general page OR
the acrolib may be independent OR it may link to a subpage ala acrolib.siny.org

siny.ua is available as a domain but costs about 150â‚¬, thats not good.

Design a general SinY logo. 
A bit more organic but still clean and vectoriseable.
Make one version with some color, one without.
The Y should be round, no corners and perhaps represent a handstand.
